# ESP32-research

This is my research done at Kennesaw State University where I was setting up the ESP32 microcontroller to make it measure humidity and temperature via the AHT10 sensor. This was done via I2C and the information received from the AHT10 sensor would be displayed in a google sheet. It would also log the time it recorded the temperature and would do so every 30 minutes; going into sleep mode for the remainder of the period.
